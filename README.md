# Discord-AI-Chat-Assistant
Hi! This is a simple, but pretty smart, AI-powered Discord bot I made. You can talk to it using the `!ask` command and it'll reply just like ChatGPT — except inside your Discord server. It also remembers what you’ve said, so conversations feel more natural over time.

# Features
Chat with an AI assistant directly in Discord

Contextual conversations with memory of previous messages

Easy to set up and customize

Powered by OpenAI’s GPT API for natural responses

# Getting Started

1. Clone the repo

2. Add your Discord bot token and OpenAI API key to .env

3. Run the bot and invite it to your server

4. Use !ask <your question> to chat with the bot
