Discord-AI-Chat-Assistant
Hi! This is a simple, yet smart AI-powered Discord bot I made. You can talk to it using the !ask command, and it will reply just like ChatGPT — right inside your Discord server. It also remembers your conversation history, so chats feel more natural and context-aware over time.

Contextual conversations with memory of previous messages

Easy to set up and customize

Powered by OpenAI’s GPT API for natural responses

Getting Started
